            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> ſervice being with much Care and Diligence performed
<pb facs="tcp:150767:3"/> by me, I expected ſome thankes for convicting and converting that Errant, and for <hi>preventing the farther ſpreading, and infection of his Error: But</hi> at least I preſumed to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a charitable Conſtruction of ſuch Paſſages in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as were ſubſervient to a farther diſcovery of Verity: and that if any had found cauſe of diſſenting from me, they would in a charitable and peaceable manner, have propounded their Exceptions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It hath</hi> now ſo fallen out, that contrary both to my deſert and expectation, <hi>A certaine clamorous and audacious Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient,</hi> a Perſon of a very weak judgement, but yet exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and arrogant, hath vented <hi>a Lawleſſe, and unlicenſed Pamphlet,</hi> digeſted <hi>Dialogue-wiſe &amp;c.</hi> wherein he Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with open mouth, that my Treatiſe of the Sabbath <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the publike Doctrine of the Church of England, touching that Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now,</hi> the whole matter and frame of his Dialogue is ſo rude, and indigeſted, and <hi>the Author thereof is ſo notorious for his ignorance, envy, and preſumption,</hi> that it rather me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits execration, than confutation: and many <hi>Perſons of worth and quality,</hi> have perſwaded me rather to contemne, than to confute, either <hi>the worke, or the workeman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> when I conſider the cauſe it ſelfe, and the humour of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious people, who are alwaies ready to conceive their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to be <hi>irrefragable Verities,</hi> if they paſſe in publike with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt reproofe; I conceive, it can be no indiſcretion in Me, or diſhonour for Me, to appeare in defence of Veritie, <hi>againſt falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and iniquitie,</hi> how baſe and unworthy ſoever the Author is, with whom I ſhall conteſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> all which I ſhall deſire of the judicious Reader is; <hi>firſt,</hi> that he take into conſideration, the maine accuſation of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt, which is; <hi>That in my Treatiſe of the Sabbath, I have overthrowne the publike Doctrine of the CHURCH of ENGLAND touching this Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150767:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that he will duely and impartially conſider, and examine in the ballance of <hi>true judgement,</hi> the Adverſaries Exceptions, and Objections againſt my Arguments and Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and my Anſwere, and confutation of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning</hi> the maine accuſation of the Objector before mentioned, the Reader may eaſily diſcerne the falſity and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it: for the Doctrine of the Church of England concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sunday, and other Holy dayes, is in plaine and expreſſe termes delivered in the Statute of <hi>Quinto</hi> and <hi>Sexto</hi> of <hi>King EDWARD</hi> the ſixt, cap. <hi>3.</hi> in manner following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither</hi> is it to be thought, that there is any certaine time, or number of dayes <hi>preſcribed in holy Scripture,</hi> but that the appointment both of the time, and alſo of the number of the dayes is left <hi>by the authoritie of God's Word,</hi> to the libertie of <hi>CHRIST</hi>'S Church to be determined, and aſsigned orderly in every Countrey, <hi>by the diſcretion of the Rulers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters thereof, as they ſhal judge moſt expedient to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of God's glorie, and the edification of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Be it therefore enacted, by the King our Sovereigne Lord, with the aſſent of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, &amp; by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſame, that all the dayes hereafter mentioned, ſhall bee kept and commanded to be kept holy dayes, and none other: that is to ſay: <hi>All Sundayes in the yeere;</hi> The dayes of the Feaſts of the Circumciſion of our Lord <hi>IESUS CHRIST;</hi> of the Epiphanie; of the Purification of the bleſſed <hi>Virgine;</hi> of S. <hi>Matthias</hi> the Apoſtle, &amp;c. And that none other day ſhall be kept holy day, or to abſtaine from lawfull bodily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> labour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> former Statute being repealed, <hi>Anno primo Mariae, cap. 2.</hi> was revived, <hi>An. prim. R. IACOBI, cap. 25.</hi> and is at this day in force, as appeareth by the booke of Statutes; <hi>pag. 894.</hi> and by the judgement of the <hi>Reverend Iudges, and Maſters in our Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Second</hi> paſſage, which I deſire the judicious Reader to
<pb facs="tcp:150767:4"/> obſerve, is; That the Doctrine concerning the Sabbath day, and the Lord's day, maintained in my Treatiſe, agreeth exactly with <hi>the unanimous Tenet of the Orthodoxall Catholike Church</hi> of ancient times: and the ſame agreeth likewiſe with the Tenet, both of all the <hi>Schoole Doctours,</hi> ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, and alſo with the Tenet of the beſt learned and most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Divines of the reformed Churches</hi> beyond Sea: And lastly, the ſame is agreeable to the Tenet of <hi>the Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> of our owne Church; <hi>Biſhop Cranmer, Iohn Frith, William Tindall, D. Barnes &amp;c.</hi> And the other opinion; That the fourth Commandement is a Precept of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and purely and intirely Morall: And that the obſervation of the Lord's Day is expreſly commanded by that Precept of the Decalogue, is a novell Poſition, repugnant to all, or moſt Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall Divines, who have inſtructed Chriſtian people in the wayes of godlineſſe, in former or moderne times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every</hi> one of the former paſſages, is ſo fully prooved and confirmed in <hi>my Treatiſe of the Sabbath,</hi> that no juſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be taken against my proceeding, in handling this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: and therefore the boldneſſe, and impudency of <hi>this blat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Dialogiſt</hi> is deteſtable, when he affirmeth, that my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Sabbath overthroweth the Doctrine of the Church of England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> all the Reward which I deſire to reape for my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in this, or in any other ſervice of the Church, is, that the Truth which I have faithfully delivered, may bee maintained, and my integrity be protected, againſt graceleſſe, impudent, and irreverent Calumniators, ſuch as the Author of the Dialogue hath proclaimed himſelfe to be, in this, and in ſome other of his <hi>lewd and lawleſſe Pamphlets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For although this Dialogue penner hath concealed his name, yet <hi>Ex ungue Leonem,</hi> the world may eaſily conjecture who the Creature is, by <hi>his foule paw:</hi> The Scope of his writing in his Pamphlets, is, to magnifie his owne Zeale, piety, and integrity,
<pb facs="tcp:150767:4"/> to perſwade the World, that he alone is left <hi>a Prophet of the LORD,</hi> and is guided with the ſpirit of Verity and Fidelity; and that the preſent Fathers and Rulers of our <hi>CHURCH,</hi> and other conformable Perſons who comply with them, are little better than Hirelings and blinde Guides: And (beſides his ignorance, which is notorious) the violent Man, is ſo far tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with <hi>bitter Zeale,</hi> that whatſoever proceeds from him, is <hi>litigious, clamorous, ſcandalous, and abuſive:</hi> and his Pamphlets are fraughted with ſuch Materials, as are apt to poyſon Chriſtian people with contempt and hatred <hi>of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Government, and preſent Religion eſtabliſhed in our CHURCH.</hi> Alſo he is poſſeſſed with a graceleſſe and malignant humour, to wit, looke whatſoever gives all other judicious and godly Perſons beſt content, enrageth him againſt ſuch as are imployed in the Governement and publike ſervice of the <hi>CHURCH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> I ſhall detaine my Reader no longer from the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Man's Quarrels and Objections vented in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue; and my Anſwer, and Reply ſhall make it evident, that the Doctrine propounded, and maintained in my Treatiſe of the Sabbath (maugre the malice of this <hi>Blatterant</hi>) standeth firme, and is not ſubject to any juſt Reproofe.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150767:20"/> and in moderne times have grounded their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, touching the neceſſary obſervation of the old legall Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>The Reader ſhall finde theſe Principles and Poſitions peremptorily taught for divine truth (by thoſe Teachers whoſe opinions the Biſhop impugneth) layed downe in his Treatiſe, <hi>Page</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The obſervation of the Seventh day, and alſo the preciſe reſting from worldly affaires, is morall; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that might intimate it to be Ceremoniall.</p>
                     <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commandement can be no more partly morall, &amp; partly Ceremoniall, than the ſame living creature can be partly a Man, and partly a beaſt.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Commandement is part of the Law of Nattre, and thus part of the Image of God, and is no more capable of a Ceremony, than God himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The fourth commandement, in every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it is contained in the Decalogue, is morall, and of the Law of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Decalogue being the ſame with the Law of Nature, is one, and the ſame for ever: it followeth neceſſarily, that the Sabbath being a part of that Decalogue, is to remain for ever.</p>
                     <p>The obſervation of the ſeventh day is of the Law of Nature: it was eſtabliſhed before Chriſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and therefore it is not ceremoniall, but of the Law of nature, and perpetuall.</p>
                     <p>The Summe and ſubſtance of the former Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions is: The fourth Commandement of the Decalogue, is purely, intirely, and totally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; it is a Precept of the Law of Nature, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150767:20"/> of the ſame quality, both for morality and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity with other Commandements of the Law of Nature, neither was there any thing Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall in it.</p>
                     <p>Now the judicious Reader will preſently obſerve, that the <hi>Sabbatarian Hereſie,</hi> concerning the perpetuall obſervation of the old Legall Sab. is a neceſſary and undeniable Concluſion, iſſuing out of the former Poſitions.</p>
                     <p>For every Law or Precept, purely, intirely, and totally morall, is perpetuall and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: the ſame muſt be intirely obſerved; and if nothing <hi>poſitive or Ceremoniall be found therein, then no branch</hi> or member thereof can ceaſe or be omitted.</p>
                     <p>But the keeping holy of the <hi>Seventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> namely Saturday, was a maine part of the fourth Commandement; for it was the Subject or materiall Object of that Commandement, literally, expreſſely, and poſitively ſpecified and commanded by God Almighty in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue.</p>
                     <p>Therefore from the Premiſes it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, that the Seventh day Sabbath, being Saturday, muſt be kept holy untill the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition is confirmed in manner following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The prime, ſpeciall, and expreſſe materiall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of every Law, is a ſubſtantiall part of that Law:</hi> and it is of the ſame kinde and quality with the Law it ſelfe: and therefore if the Law be intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and naturally morall, then the expreſſe and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150767:21"/> ſpeciall object of the ſame, is of the ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>For example, in the fifth Commandement of the Decalogue, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> Naturall Parents are the prime, ſpeciall, and expreſſe Object of that Law: therefore although other Objects may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as <hi>honour the King; give honour to Presbyters</hi> that rule well; <hi>honour Maſters, &amp;c.</hi> Yet natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Father and Mother being named, expreſſed, and ſpecified in the Commandement, remaine indelible, becauſe they are the prime Object thereof.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, if the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were naturall and intirely morall, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fifth: then the particular day expreſſed and deſcribed therein, namely Saturday, muſt be obſerved, although the Apoſtles and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church might adde the Lord's-day and ſome other Feſtivals, for the enlarging of the ſervice of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Biſhop alſo in his Treatiſe, 235. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 249. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath obſerved certaine deſperate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in thoſe mens Sermons and Tractats, whom he ſtileth <hi>Novell Sabbatarians:</hi> to wit,</p>
                     <p>To doe any ſervile worke or buſineſſe upon the Lord's-day, is as great a ſinne, as to kill a man, or to commit adultery.</p>
                     <p>To throw a Bowle on the Sabbath-day, is as great a ſinne, as to kill a man: And to make a Feast or Wedding-dinner on the Lord's day, is as great a ſin, as for a father to take a knife and cut his childes throat.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:150767:21"/>
                     <p>To ring more Bels than one upon the Lord's-day to call the People to Church, is as great a ſin as to commit murder.</p>
                     <p>In Harvest time, though the Corne be in danger, yet better were it for us that it ſhould rot on the ground, than for us by carrying it in with the breach of the Sabbath, to treaſure up unto ourſelves wrath, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is not lawfull for people to go out of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to walke in the fields.</p>
                     <p>Theſe former Dictats are borrowed from the old <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the moderne Authors who have revived and maintained them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply herein with <hi>Sabbatarian Hereticks.</hi>

                  <p>It ſeemes therefore, that the Homily hath not moſt clearely, and fully declared all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be knowne, touching this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the Homily ſaith: <hi>Whatſoever is found in the fourth Commandement, appertaining to the Law of Nature, as a thing moſt godly, moſt juſt, and needfull for the ſetting forth of God's glory, it ought to be retained of all good Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our of the former words it may be collected, that nothing in the fourth Commandement is ſimply morall, and of the Law of Nature, but that which is moſt godly, moſt juſt, and neceſſary for the ſetting forth of Gods glory: And if this be the ſence of the Homily (as no doubt it is) then the fourth Commandement is not in force ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter, but only according to the equity and Analogie thereof.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly the Homily ſaith: <hi>God hath given ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath Day, which is now our Sunday, they ſhould ceaſe from all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150767:23"/> weekely, and worke-day labour: and God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the obſervation of this Holy day: and we muſt be carefull to keep the Sabbath day, which is the Sunday.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of the former paſſage, theſe queſtions ariſe. 1.

Or whether the meaning of the Homily is not, that God hath thus commanded Chriſtians, by a mediate or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall Law, and precept of his Church.</p>

                  <p>Now from the precedent obſervations, it is conſequent, that the Doctrine of the Church of England is not <hi>moſt clearly,</hi> or ſo plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſet forth in the Homily, as this Objector pretendeth when he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. <hi>The words of the Homily, as you have heard, and every one may plainely ſee, are ſo expreſſe, cleare, and full, that they cannot poſsibly admit the least ambiguity.</hi>

                     <p>The Homily of the time and place of prayer, <hi>part firſt,</hi> ſheweth, <hi>That</hi> our Lord's Day is grounded upon the fourth Commandement of the Decalogue, in theſe words: <hi>Whatſoever is contained in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement appertaining to the Law of Nature, as a thing most godly, moſt juſt and needefull
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150767:24"/> for the ſetting forth of Gods glory, it ought to be retained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and kept of all good Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and</hi> therefore by this Commandement we ought to have a time, <hi>as</hi> one day in the weeke, wherein we ought to reſt, yea from our lawfull, and needfull workes.</p>
                     <p>For like as it appeareth by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that no man in the ſixe dayes, ought to be ſlothfull, or idle, but diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to labour in that ſtate wherein God hath ſet him: even ſo GOD hath given ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge to all men, that upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, which is now our Sunday, they ſhould ceaſe from all weekely and worke day labour; to the intent, that like as God Himſelfe wrought ſixe dayes, and reſted the Seventh, and bleſſed, and ſanctified, and conſecrated it to quietneſſe, and reſt from labour; even ſo God's obedient People ſhould uſe the Sunday holily, and reſt from their common and daily buſineſſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo give themſelves wholly to heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſes of God's true Religion and Service.</p>
                     <p>So that God doth not onely command the Obſervation of this Holy Day, <hi>but</hi> alſo by his own example doth ſtir and provoke
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150767:25"/> us to the diligent keeping of the ſame. Good natural children wil not only becom obedient to the Commandement of their Parents, but alſo have a diligent eye to their doings, and gladly follow the ſame: <hi>So</hi> if we will bee the children of our Heavenly Father, wee muſt be carefull to keepe the Chriſtian Sabbath Day, which is the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, not only for that it is God's expreſſe Commandement, but alſo to declare our ſelves to bee loving children in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of our Gracious Lord and Father.</p>
                     <p>Againe thus it may plainely appeare, that God's will and Commandement was to have a ſolemne time, and ſtanding day in the week, wherein the People ſhould come together, and have in remembrance his wonderfull benefits, and to render Him thankes for them, as appertaineth to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, kind and obedient People. <hi>This</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Commandement of God the godly Chriſtian people began to follow immediately after the Aſcenſion of our Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So the Homily, and much more,</hi> whence we plainely obſerve theſe concluſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:150767:25"/>1 That all Chriſtians ought, and are bound in conſcience of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to keep the Lord's-day holily.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 That the keeping of the Lord's-day is grounded upon, and commanded in the fourth Commandement, and ſo is not of humane inſtitution.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That the Lord's-day is, and may bee called our Chriſtian Sabbath-day, therefore it is not Iewiſh to call it ſo.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 That this Day is wholly to be ſpent in holy reſt and duties of ſanctification; <hi>and therefore</hi> no part of it to be ſpent in vaine pleaſures, and prophane paſtimes.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>the Author</hi> of the Treatiſe doth overthrow all theſe concluſions: for <hi>page</hi> 23. his words are: <hi>This Poſition (to wit, that the fourth Commandement is properly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually morall, and is for quality and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equall to the other nine Commandements,</hi> which for many yeares hath raigned in Pamphlets, Pulpits, and Conventicles; and is entertained as an Oracle, by all ſuch as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150767:26"/> openly profeſſe, or doe leane towards the diſciplinarian faction) is deſtitute of truth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are his words: <hi>which</hi> comparing with the words of the Homily of our Church already cited, are found quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>For</hi> the Homily ſaith: <hi>That the fourth Commandement is a Law of Nature,</hi> and ought to be retained and kept of all good Chriſtians, in as much as it commandeth one day of the Weeke for reſt: and God hath given an expreſſe charge to all Men, that the Sabbath-day, which is our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, ſhould be ſpent wholly in heavenly exerciſes, of God's true Religion and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

                  <p>The Summe of the former accuſation is, <hi>That the Biſhop in his Treatiſe overthrowes the Doctrine of the Church of England in the point of the Sabbath: For</hi> his Doctrine is repugnant to the <hi>Homily, &amp;c. which</hi> teacheth that <hi>the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is of the Law of Nature, &amp;c. and</hi> that all Chriſtians ought to keep it holily: <hi>and</hi> one day in ſeven is perpetually to be kept holy: <hi>the</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord's-day is commanded by the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commandement: <hi>The</hi> Lord's-day may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Chriſtian Sabbath-day. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the Lord's-day ought wholly to be ſpent in holy reſt, and duties of ſanctification.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 The argument it ſelfe is of no force: <hi>For</hi> although all power of conſtituting time, for his owne worſhip, bee <hi>eminently and originally</hi> in God himſelfe, as likewiſe is the teaching of all ſupernaturall truth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.8. <hi>Yet</hi> there is given to the Paſtors of the Church, <hi>a derivative,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150767:40"/> delegate, and miniſteriall power,</hi> both to teach God's people, and likewiſe to appoint ſet, fixed, and convenient dayes, and times and places, for religious worſhip, <hi>pag.</hi> 187.</p>
                  <p>Where the great Lord and Maſter himſelfe hath by his owne expreſſe, or immediate Law, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a particular day or time, for his owne worſhip, <hi>It</hi> is not lawfull for man, to alter the ſame: <hi>and</hi> therefore the Iewes in the Old Law, might not change their Sabbath into another day: <hi>But the Church by miniſteriall, and delegate power, may adde, and increaſe the number of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous holy dayes,</hi> if it be neceſſary or expedient for the peoples edification.</p>
                  <p>For in the very time of the Old Law, when many feſtivall dayes were ordained by God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mandate, <hi>the</hi> Iewiſh Church, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, upon ſpeciall occaſions, appointed ſome new Holy Dayes, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 9. 17. 1 <hi>Machab.</hi> 4.56. <hi>and our bleſſed Saviour Himſelfe</hi> honoured one of theſe feaſts, with his owne preſence, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.22. <hi>But</hi> now in the time of the N.

                  <p>But if this Rule which the Dialogue Dauber hath approved, is authenticall; <hi>then</hi> we can ſee no reaſon, <hi>wherefore</hi> it may not be lawfull for us, as well as for him, to expound the words of <hi>the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> in point of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> according to the ſenſe of holy Scripture. <hi>And</hi> if we may do this, <hi>then</hi> it is undoubtedly true, that it was not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Homily</hi> to make the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Precept of the Law of Nature; or a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Precept purely, intirely, and properly ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Our requeſt likewiſe is, that <hi>Br. B.</hi> would make a review of a confident Argument propounded by him againſt the Appealer in his Plea, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. the ſcope whereof is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>His Argument is as followeth; <hi>A mortall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150767:53"/> begets a mortall Son:</hi> So <hi>the immortall God can beget no Son, but he is immortall.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now it is impoſsible for the immortall God to dye, no not for a moment.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But upon the foreſaid ground, <hi>Br. B.</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, and conclude, that no perſon once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, can poſſibly ſin at any time, in thought, word, or deed, neither can hee die a temporall death. <hi>For</hi> if God Almighty, being a Father of the regenerate, hath begotten all his ſonnes, in nature like himſelfe, and it is impoſſible for God Himſelfe, either to dye, or to ſinne: Then it will likewiſe be impoſſible, for any Regenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſinne, in thought, word, or deed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at any time covet or lye, or tranſgreſſe any Divine Law, neither can they dye a temporall Death.</p>

               <head>Brother <hi>B.</hi> in his Dialogue hath theſe remarkable Paſſages following.</head>
               <div type="section">
                  <p n="1">1 The Tenet of the Dialogiſt is, <hi>That</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commandement of the Decalogue, delivered in this forme of words: <hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath-day, &amp;c. The ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke, &amp;c. The Lord reſted the ſeventh day, &amp;c.</hi> commandeth in expreſſe termes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obſervation of the Lord's-day: <hi>and</hi> the ſame is a commandement of the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now from hence it is conſequent: 1. <hi>That Saturday and Sunday,</hi> being two diſtinct and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes of the Weeke, if the Commandement be naturall and expreſſe for the one, it cannot be naturall and expreſſe for the other, unleſſe the one day were named, expreſſed, or deſcribed in the ſame, as well as the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the <hi>Iewes</hi> were obliged to the religious obſervation of the <hi>Saturday</hi> by the Law of the fourth Commandement, which was <hi>Poſitive</hi> in reſpect of that day: and Chriſtians are bound to keepe holy the <hi>Sunday,</hi> by the very ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as by the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:150767:80"/>
                  <p>Now all judicious men confeſſe, that <hi>the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Commandement concerning keeping holy the ſaturday, was a Poſitive Law: Therefore</hi> we deſire <hi>Br. B.</hi> to cleare this contradiction: to wit, how it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Law of the fourth Commandement, concerning <hi>Saturday,</hi> being <hi>Poſitive, The</hi> ſame Law (according to his Tenet commanding <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>) can be <hi>Naturall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, let this <hi>bould Bayard</hi> reſolve Vs, how the obſervation of the Lord's-day, can be ſaid to be expreſſely commanded in the fourth Precept of the Decalogue, when <hi>Saturday</hi> only, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day is expreſſed, either by the words of that Precept, or is concluded from the words or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences thereof, by any formall or neceſſary il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let him reſolve Vs, how we may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude from the expreſſe words of the fourth Commandement, that <hi>Sunday is</hi> to be kepr holy by that <hi>Law: For</hi> if this man will argue rightly, hee muſt proceed in this or the like manner. The fourth Commandement literally and expreſſely, enjoyneth the Obſervation of <hi>Saturday:</hi> and <hi>the Precept concerning Saturday is Legally Poſitive:</hi> Therefore Chriſtians muſt obſerve <hi>Sunday,</hi> by vertue of ſuch a Law as was <hi>Legally Poſitive</hi> for keeping of Saturday.</p>
